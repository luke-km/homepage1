# Launch

A personalized minimal startpage.

From [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages):

> A startpage is the page you first see when you open your browser. A custom startpage may have links to your favourite sites and maybe a search box for your favourite search engine.


## Customizing

First, if you decide to use this startpage, be sure to personalize the links in `index.html` to your liking.
